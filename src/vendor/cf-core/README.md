# cf-core

[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/cfpb/cf-core.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/cfpb/cf-core)

Core styles for starting a Capital Framework project.
It includes Normalize.css, variables, media query and utility mixins,
class utilities and standard base styling.
This component can be used by itself, but it was made for Capital Framework,
a new front end framework developed at the
[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://cfpb.github.io/).

If you would like to take advantage of more components or if you're new to
Capital Framework, we encourage you to [start here](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/).
